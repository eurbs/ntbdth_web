meet george;We need your help. My name is George, and if you're reading this, you're one of many thousands who have seen this message. Those capable of helping us have either turned away or have simply failed. Nine years ago, I was diagnosed with a disease causing fast-spreading neural deterioration. At first, it was thought to be Alzheimers or other similar neurodegenerative disease, however after agreeing to have my brain biopsied, there was no presence of the amyloid-β nor tau plaques frequently associated with the disease. In layman's terms, my brain was falling apart and nobody could tell me why... If you can help me, I've spread my story throughout your world.;The piece of the puzzle is hidden under your girlfriend's favorite part of your backyard. Hurry.
the clue you seek is hidden in a game you've yet to beat;After seeing many specialists, I was introduced to an experimental trial group two years after discovering I was dying. Dr. Hand led the trials, and he first introduced me to Margret. She was a woman of sixty-some-odd years, donning a head of jet-black hair with only a handful of grey hairs which she complained about incessantly. She had been a patient of Hand's for about ten years, so I finally had hope after being shuffled around from doctor to doctor, pleading for an answer. Truthfully, I was pleading for something that simply didn't exist. After about a year, death would have been preferable to the suffering brought on by uncertainty. The clock ticked erratically as I began to lose my mind.;This next one should be easy for you. Earlier this summer, you recieved a few short novels from your girlfriend.One of them holds the key. For security's sake, I've created a new measure of uniqueness. (number of lonely words) * (number of duplicate words). Type up the letters and write something to do this for you. Have you met python + regex yet? (hint. I'm->im; all content is fair game)
19968;As you can imagine, meeting Margret changed my life, because once I did, my insanity picked up and left. I could look at my watch once more without my heart skipping one to five beats. Reality began to seep back into my life, concentrating the world I had made up in the darkest corners of my brain. Margret recalled having a similar experience when became the first of the trial subjects. Suddenly, I found myself easing into my newfound life.;What do this csv (https://www.dropbox.com/s/3hzzhv84ly8n0lo/haHA.csv?dl=0) and sharing have in common? Stay tuned to the words and remember that we've had a lot of firsts this year. Remember that all of these clues are case-sensitive.
friends;A few days later, I was introduced to the rest of the trial group. Dwayne and Jeffrey quickly became my two closest friends in the group of fifteen. Those two couldn't be much different from one another. They grew up down the street from one another. Dwayne came from a well-off family, but struggled to find himself. Jeffrey's room was the basement of his house, and he and Dwayne used to play video games for hours together there. Even single player games they didn't mind sharing, because they were happy to have one another's company. The outcome of the game was never the objective. Jeffrey was the first of the two in the trial group and was followed by Dwayne just under a year later. Sam, Andrew, Yvette, Jordan, and PJ comprised the remainder of the group.;bomb. sure stop pun Dana lux max hew aptly hue. if mae prob ak lux. if but a up lat. cum opt. coo let. ass! oaf!!

He responded saying that he refused to give a name to the disease – it wasn't worthy of one. He believed in nothing more than his abilities, but that began to change as he watched his son wither away from something similar over twenty years ago. An early onset neurodegenerative disease would not have made sense for his six year old son Thomas.Though he never verbalized it, everybody knows Hand blames himself daily for the inevitable loss of his son. Even his smile is never quite full, and his eyes remain matte no matter how excited he claims to be. He would always mumble to himself, frequently saying, &quotIf you're still with me...&quot and then he trails off.;<img src="/questquest.png" />
didsomeonesaymusic;PJ once explained to me that Dr. Hand used to tell him when life took life as its fuel, life was onto something. The doctor believed in no god more powerful than himself, yet he seemed to disagree that evolution was entirely randomized. Somehow, life was being propagated in many forms in an internal battle against the second law of thermodynamics. How is it that on Earth, life gets more orderly while entropy is always increasing? It never made sense to him, so he's dedicated his lif to figuring out what was so important that his son had to die for it.;Can you find the 5 character English word <a href=https://www.dropbox.com/s/hi4j1g1i3twqpnm/tuned.m4a?dl=0>here</a>?
faded;&quotYou're not a hopeless case,&quot Dr. Hand explained to me during one of my treatments. I was feeling uneasy, because I was no longer able to control some of the movements in my left hand. Almost like a heartbeat, my pinky finger had just started extending and folding approximately once every two seconds – something I've now been living with for 14 months. Of course, these figures are only approximates, at night the extensions generally speed up, but whenever I exert myself in any sort of physical activity, they slow to only about two per minute. I also experience some amnesia and have lost some perceptual abilities. It's not that I'm going blind though, I just sometimes have difficulties distinguishing between horizontal and vertical lines. Connecting faces to the sound of voices can sometimes feel like those people are imposters. In short, I'm developing a wide variety of neurological conditions that manifest themselves in the oddest of ways, and none of them are full-blown.;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and today breakfast foods eaten after noon don't count. <br><br>Format: seventeen all lowercase groups of characters. no punctuation.
i would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that cant be questioned feynman;To make matters worse, scans would show my brain deteriorating in those regions associated with motor control, visual perception, and memory. It appeared more like moths were flying through my brain, eating out itty-bitty holes rather than ravishing an entire section before moving on. Eventually, my brain started to look like fabric under a microscope. This was the signature of the disease. Still, I was never satisfied with these answers. If something were destroying my brain, then I wouldn't still have the ability to move my body in ways indicative of voluntary control. Twitching, maybe, but finger extensions just didn't seem possible. Nevertheless, my session continued. With EEG electrodes stuck to my head and spine, I was submerged into a pool of lukewarm water. I never know how long I'm left in the pool, because time seems to stop entirely during these sessions. I come out feeling drowsy, and sleep it off for days at a time.;Don't you have plans today?<br><br>The following clue should provide sufficient direction.

welcome home;So why are you here? Well, at this point, you must have collected a sufficient amount of clues. I'm sorry that it took so long to get to this point. You see, if the clues weren't hidden in the physical world, he would be able to get to them without being noticed. He is a computer of sorts, and I've fallen victim. I don't have a disease in the traditional sense. We've been infected by microscopic pathogens for years and years. We've been at the mercy of nucleic acids and patterns of gene expression for as long as life has been around. DNA is the life-powering code after all. We've never had control of it, and even now that the entire human genome has been sequenced, we still don't have the slightest idea how those genes are regulated. Life is some complex process that can be thought of as a collection of programmers following a try, fail, and try again method of elimination. Programmers are lazy though, and deprecated code lingers for years and years. It's no wonder computers have had viruses for years as well, but I digress. You're here because we're infected by...;Saving game... Check back Monday.
