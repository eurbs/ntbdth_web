the clue you seek is hidden in a game you've yet to beat;After seeing many specialists, I was introduced to an experimental trial group two years after discovering I was dying. Dr. Hand led the trials, and he first introduced me to Margret. She was a woman of sixty-some-odd years, donning a head of jet-black hair with only a handful of grey hairs which she complained about incessantly.

friends;A few days later, I was introduced to the rest of the trial group. Dwayne and Jeffrey quickly became my two closest friends in the group of fifteen. Those two couldn't be much different from one another. They grew up down the street from one another. Dwayne came from a well-off family, but struggled to find himself. Jeffrey's room was the basement of his house, and he and Dwayne used to play video games for hours together there. Even single player games they didn't mind sharing, because they were happy to have one another's company. The outcome of the game was never the objective.
