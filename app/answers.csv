meet george;We need your help. My name is George, and if you're reading this, you're one of many thousands who have seen this message. Those capable of helping us have either turned away or have simply failed. Nine years ago, I was diagnosed with a disease causing fast-spreading neural deterioration. At first, it was thought to be Alzheimers or other similar neurodegenerative disease, however after agreeing to have my brain biopsied, there was no presence of the amyloid-β nor tau plaques frequently associated with the disease. In layman's terms, my brain was falling apart and nobody could tell me why... If you can help me, I've spread my story throughout your world.;The piece of the puzzle is hidden under your girlfriend's favorite part of your backyard. Hurry.
the clue you seek is hidden in a game you've yet to beat;After seeing many specialists, I was introduced to an experimental trial group two years after discovering I was dying. Dr. Hand led the trials, and he first introduced me to Margret. She was a woman of sixty-some-odd years, donning a head of jet-black hair with only a handful of grey hairs which she complained about incessantly. She had been a patient of Hand's for about ten years, so I finally had hope after being shuffled around from doctor to doctor, pleading for an answer. Truthfully, I was pleading for something that simply didn't exist. After about a year, death would have been preferable to the suffering brought on by uncertainty. The clock ticked erratically as I began to lose my mind.;This next one should be easy for you. Earlier this summer, you recieved a few short novels from your girlfriend.One of them holds the key. For security's sake, I've created a new measure of uniqueness. (number of lonely words) * (number of duplicate words). Type up the letters and write something to do this for you. Have you met python + regex yet? (hint. I'm->im; all content is fair game)
19968;As you can imagine, meeting Margret changed my life, because once I did, my insanity picked up and left. I could look at my watch once more without my heart skipping one to five beats. Reality began to seep back into my life, concentrating the world I had made up in the darkest corners of my brain. Margret recalled having a similar experience when became the first of the trial subjects. Suddenly, I found myself easing into my newfound life.;What do this csv (https://www.dropbox.com/s/3hzzhv84ly8n0lo/haHA.csv?dl=0) and sharing have in common? Stay tuned to the words and remember that we've had a lot of firsts this year. Remember that all of these clues are case-sensitive.
friends;A few days later, I was introduced to the rest of the trial group. Dwayne and Jeffrey quickly became my two closest friends in the group of fifteen. Those two couldn't be much different from one another. They grew up down the street from one another. Dwayne came from a well-off family, but struggled to find himself. Jeffrey's room was the basement of his house, and he and Dwayne used to play video games for hours together there. Even single player games they didn't mind sharing, because they were happy to have one another's company. The outcome of the game was never the objective. Jeffrey was the first of the two in the trial group and was followed by Dwayne just under a year later. Sam, Andrew, Yvette, Jordan, and PJ comprised the remainder of the group.;bomb. sure stop pun Dana lux max hew aptly hue. if mae prob ak lux. if but a up lat. cum opt. coo let. ass! oaf!!
bomb. sure stop pun Dana lux max hew aptly hue. if mae prob ak lux. if but a up lat. cum opt. coo let. ass! oaf!!;In one of my early sessions with the doctor, I mustered up the courage to ask him about how he got involved in doing research for it. He responded saying that he refused to give a name to the disease – it wasn't worthy of one. He believed in nothing more than his abilities, but that began to change as he watched his son wither away from something similar over twenty years ago. An early onset neurodegenerative disease would not have made sense for his six year old son Thomas.Though he never verbalized it, everybody knows Hand blames himself daily for the inevitable loss of his son. Even his smile is never quite full, and his eyes remain matte no matter how excited he claims to be. He would always mumble to himself, frequently saying, "If you're still with me..." and then he trails off.;<img src="/questquest.png" />
didsomeonesaymusic;PJ once explained to me that Dr. Hand used to tell him when life took life as its fuel, life was onto something. The doctor believed in no god more powerful than himself, yet he seemed to disagree that evolution was entirely randomized. Somehow, life was being propagated in many forms in an internal battle against the second law of thermodynamics. How is it that on Earth, life gets more orderly while entropy is always increasing? It never made sense to him, so he's dedicated his life to figuring out what was so important that his son had to die for it.;check back later for your next clue
