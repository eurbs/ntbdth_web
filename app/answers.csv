meet george;We need your help. My name is George, and if you're reading this, you're one of many thousands who have seen this message. Those capable of helping us have either turned away or have simply failed. Nine years ago, I was diagnosed with a disease causing fast-spreading neural deterioration. At first, it was thought to be Alzheimers or other similar neurodegenerative disease, however after agreeing to have my brain biopsied, there was no presence of the amyloid-β nor tau plaques frequently associated with the disease. In layman's terms, my brain was falling apart and nobody could tell me why... If you can help me, I've spread my story throughout your world.;The piece of the puzzle is hidden under your girlfriend's favorite part of your backyard. Hurry.
the clue you seek is hidden in a game you've yet to beat;After seeing many specialists, I was introduced to an experimental trial group two years after discovering I was dying. Dr. Hand led the trials, and he first introduced me to Margret. She was a woman of sixty-some-odd years, donning a head of jet-black hair with only a handful of grey hairs which she complained about incessantly. She had been a patient of Hand's for about ten years, so I finally had hope after being shuffled around from doctor to doctor, pleading for an answer. Truthfully, I was pleading for something that simply didn't exist. After about a year, death would have been preferable to the suffering brought on by uncertainty. The clock ticked erratically as I began to lose my mind.;This next one should be easy for you. Earlier this summer, you recieved a few short novels from your girlfriend.One of them holds the key.

Have you met python + regex yet? (hint. I'm->im; all content is fair game)
19968;As you can imagine, meeting Margret changed my life, because once I did, my insanity picked up and left. I could look at my watch once more without my heart skipping one to five beats. Reality began to seep back into my life, concentrating the world I had made up in the darkest corners of my brain. Margret recalled having a similar experience when became the first of the trial subjects. Suddenly, I found myself easing into my newfound life.;What do this csv (https://www.dropbox.com/s/3hzzhv84ly8n0lo/haHA.csv?dl=0) and sharing have in common? Stay tuned to the words and remember that we've had a lot of firsts this year. Remember that all of these clues are case-sensitive.
friends;A few days later, I was introduced to the rest of the trial group. Dwayne and Jeffrey quickly became my two closest friends in the group of fifteen. Those two couldn't be much different from one another. They grew up down the street from one another. Dwayne came from a well-off family, but struggled to find himself. Jeffrey's room was the basement of his house, and he and Dwayne used to play video games for hours together there. Even single player games they didn't mind sharing, because they were happy to have one another's company. The outcome of the game was never the objective. Jeffrey was the first of the two in the trial group and was followed by Dwayne just under a year later. Sam, Andrew, Yvette, Jordan, and PJ comprised the remainder of the group.;bomb. sure stop pun Dana lux max hew aptly hue. if mae prob ak lux. if but a up lat. cum opt. coo let. ass! oaf!!

He responded saying that he refused to give a name to the disease – it wasn't worthy of one. He believed in nothing more than his abilities, but that began to change as he watched his son wither away from something similar over twenty years ago. An early onset neurodegenerative disease would not have made sense for his six year old son Thomas.Though he never verbalized it, everybody knows Hand blames himself daily for the inevitable loss of his son. Even his smile is never quite full, and his eyes remain matte no matter how excited he claims to be. He would always mumble to himself, frequently saying, &quotIf you're still with me...&quot and then he trails off.;<img src="/questquest.png" />
didsomeonesaymusic;PJ once explained to me that Dr. Hand used to tell him when life took life as its fuel, life was onto something. The doctor believed in no god more powerful than himself, yet he seemed to disagree that evolution was entirely randomized. Somehow, life was being propagated in many forms in an internal battle against the second law of thermodynamics. How is it that on Earth, life gets more orderly while entropy is always increasing? It never made sense to him, so he's dedicated his lif to figuring out what was so important that his son had to die for it.;Can you find the 5 character English word <a href=https://www.dropbox.com/s/hi4j1g1i3twqpnm/tuned.m4a?dl=0>here</a>?
faded;&quotYou're not a hopeless case,&quot Dr. Hand explained to me during one of my treatments. I was feeling uneasy, because I was no longer able to control some of the movements in my left hand. Almost like a heartbeat, my pinky finger had just started extending and folding approximately once every two seconds – something I've now been living with for 14 months. Of course, these figures are only approximates, at night the extensions generally speed up, but whenever I exert myself in any sort of physical activity, they slow to only about two per minute. I also experience some amnesia and have lost some perceptual abilities. It's not that I'm going blind though, I just sometimes have difficulties distinguishing between horizontal and vertical lines. Connecting faces to the sound of voices can sometimes feel like those people are imposters. In short, I'm developing a wide variety of neurological conditions that manifest themselves in the oddest of ways, and none of them are full-blown.;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and today breakfast foods eaten after noon don't count. <br><br>Format: seventeen all lowercase groups of characters. no punctuation.

It appeared more like moths were flying through my brain, eating out itty-bitty holes rather than ravishing an entire section before moving on. Eventually, my brain started to look like fabric under a microscope. This was the signature of the disease. Still, I was never satisfied with these answers. If something were destroying my brain, then I wouldn't still have the ability to move my body in ways indicative of voluntary control. Twitching, maybe, but finger extensions just didn't seem possible. Nevertheless, my session continued. With EEG electrodes stuck to my head and spine, I was submerged into a pool of lukewarm water. I never know how long I'm left in the pool, because time seems to stop entirely during these sessions. I come out feeling drowsy, and sleep it off for days at a time.;Don't you have plans today?<br><br>The following clue should provide sufficient direction. Drive. Beware. It is dangerous to go alone.

welcome home;So why are you here? Well, at this point, you must have collected a sufficient amount of clues. I'm sorry that it took so long to get to this point. You see, if the clues weren't hidden in the physical world, he would be able to get to them without being noticed. He is a computer of sorts, and I've fallen victim. I don't have a disease in the traditional sense. We've been infected by microscopic pathogens for years and years. We've been at the mercy of nucleic acids and patterns of gene expression for as long as life has been around. DNA is the life-powering code after all. We've never had control of it, and even now that the entire human genome has been sequenced, we still don't have the slightest idea how those genes are regulated. Life is some complex process that can be thought of as a collection of programmers following a try, fail, and try again method of elimination. Programmers are lazy though, and deprecated code lingers for years and years. It's no wonder computers have had viruses for years as well, but I digress.

commandlineadventure_aksjhdfklashdfkasdhj;The treatments were designed to knock us out for hours, with medications seeping through our pores. We were never sick, but it's human nature to look for answers when every other doctor out there says that your brain is deteriorating, and to some extent it is. I no longer have control over the regions of my brain with the holes, but these holes only disguise what is actually happening. It would seem that I began sleepwalking after these treatments, but my brain functioning didn't keep me asleep once. I woke up standing in Hand's office, listening in past the door at a conversation that I thought he was having with himself. Without any control of my own actions, I moved over to the file cabinet and began looking at the scans of each of the trial group member's brains. After looking over everyone's files for hours on end, I found the holes in everyone's brain follow a specific pattern. It's not a similar pattern, but rather an exact pattern that winds up being facilitated by the holes. It was hard to spot, because when thinking about neurodegeneration, everybody first looks at the spaces where there are no longer brain cells, but here, the pattern wasn't in what was missing, it was in the few cells that remained. Those remaining neurons are arranged in a particular order as to invoke a sign on sequence. No additional information can be passed in, and there must be only one route to the netted off section of neurons. Always, this was a set of seven neurons strung together leading to a larger area of brain tissue. The holes make it so that those action potentials do not propagate to nearby neurons, thereby going unnoticed by the brain.

Instead, it meant "If you're still connected and can still hear me." He repeated those lines many times, but I could never quite get a hold on the rest of his sentences, but it finally made sense. Everything made sense. My brain is being harvested for space for Hand's son to live, and there isn't anything I can do about it, but I'm still desperate enough to try. Nobody knows if Thomas is still out there somewhere, but one thing is for sure, Dr. Hand has built up a network of people hosting his child's consciousness. It's starting to become terrifying though. It's one thing for him to enter our minds. There's no telling how much access he has to our most personal thoughts. I've been losing control to another person who is going to leave me with just enough resources to continue living on my own, so he doesn't have to do much of anything to maintain hosting. My finger extensions are a constant reminder that I don't own my own brain anymore.;Oh, how your ambitions have <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/4qjhP5F7LGhpAAie6">changed</a>!
a garbage man;It's also spreading, and I don't know how. It's not artificial intelligence that we need to be worried about, it's human intelligence – it's always been human intelligence. We never thought that a person's computing power could be extended. We've been thinking that by modeling the human brain, we could get computers to reach a level of intelligence comparable with that of humans. We've feared that once they reached that point, they would quickly learn how to continue to expand and advance so quickly that people lost control of their creations. It didn't work out like that. One person modeled his existence over that of computers rather than the reverse as we were expecting, and now one person alone is on his way to having ubiquitous power. Since Thomas is a distributed human, he cannot move through the world yet. He doesn't have control of an entire body, and twitching fingers aren't going to help him much. Thomas relies on the seven neuron sequence to access the portions of brains that are set aside for him. If my hunch is correct, if we can destroy these pathways, we perhaps have a shot at restricting the expansion of Thomas without killing everyone already infected. Many neurons differentiate in a different spot from where they wind up, and they travel along radial glia util they reach their destinations. I think that on those same paths, Thomas moves all of the cells out of the way to create the access sequence. If we can revert the environment to normal, these cells may move back to where they were, thereby restricting access and restoring brains back to their rightful owners.

13804;"Thomas is still here with you, Dad." That's my best guess at his access code. We can try overloading the access, causing an exceptional release of neurotransmitters into the extracellular space. Nearby neurons may start to pick up on these signals, growing closer to the access code areas. This would break the code because it cannot be verified anymore, since it would be the equivalent of writing a hybrid of a "T" and "F" on an exam question that you're unsure of. That automatically gets you no points. I can't guarantee that it will work, but if you can come try it on me first, maybe this can cure everybody. I only need your help to free myself of Thomas before I can freely work without being watched. Will you help me?;check back later for your next clue
yesbutton_kjsdhflaksjdhf;You travel to the facility run by Dr. Hand and meet with George, but you later hear a scream. Thousands of voices react. There aren't just ten test subjects. There are thousands. Those are the people that have seen the initial message from George and have fallen into the same trap. You realize that diseases need to be spread through some sort of contact, especially when the blood-brain barrier needs to be crossed. The only way then to spread to new brains was through Thomas' vast social network of captured memories. By doing this, he was able to tailor the quest to find him to each individual. You start thinking how you could possibly miss this crucial detail, but decide now isn't the time to be beating yourself up. Terrified, you freeze up, but manage to shake it off. As you turn your head to begin running, you don't see anything but a crimson red brick out of the corner of your eye. You black out.;check back later for your next clue
nobutton_kjashdfklasdhflk;You put this quest out of your mind, until news breaks of an army led by "T." Millions of people from all over the world have banded together to fight for T, but have never seen him. You were to join or die. The world was launched into a state of chaos, as the army grew exponentially quickly. You were smart to say "no" to George's plea for help. How would he know to hide the path to him through clues in a way that was so personal? You become one of the few in a hidden camp, with limited to no social interaction with the people from outside villages. There was no way to know who was the enemy and who wasn't, but you become the leader of your village with the external knowledge you hold: "T" is Thomas, "T" is George, and "T" is every single one of the members of the army. There's no way to escape something nor someone that has invaded your brain, and now it is time to take action.;check back later for your next clue
